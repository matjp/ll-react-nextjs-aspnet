## Lending Library (NextJS with Express server for DB Updates)

This is a minimal app implementing a simple lending library for e-books.

It is implemented as a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

An express server implements a REST API and handles DB updates. API calls are made using fetch with CSR.
